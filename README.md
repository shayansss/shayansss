# PhD and MSc Research Projects

Below is a selection of repositories related to my doctoral and master’s research work:

* **EHML: Extended Hybrid Machine Learning**
  Implementation of advanced extensions to hybrid machine learning frameworks, including physics-constrained data augmentation for multi-fidelity surrogate modeling. Developed using TensorFlow and integrated with Abaqus finite element simulations.
  Repository: [https://github.com/shayansss/ehml](https://github.com/shayansss/ehml)

* **PSA: Pre-Stress Algorithm**
  A unified optimization framework for large-scale pre-stressing analysis in articular cartilage models. Implemented using Abaqus Fortran subroutines combined with Python-based automation scripts.
  Repository: [https://github.com/shayansss/psa](https://github.com/shayansss/psa)

* **HML: Hybrid Machine Learning**
  Implementation of a novel hybrid machine learning methodology for multi-fidelity surrogate modeling of finite element simulations, with applications in multi-physics modeling of soft biological tissues.
  Repository: [https://github.com/shayansss/hml](https://github.com/shayansss/hml)

* **PMSE: Pointwise Mean Squared Error**
  Development of a pointwise error metric tailored for machine-learning-based surrogate modeling. Implemented in Python using Keras and coupled with Abaqus simulations.
  Repository: [https://github.com/shayansss/pmse](https://github.com/shayansss/pmse)

* **BioUMAT: Abaqus Fortran Subroutines for Cartilage Multiphase Modeling**
  Fortran 77 implementation of UMAT, FLOW, and SDVINI subroutines for a multiphasic cartilage model originally proposed in my Master’s thesis. With minor refinements, this model has been used in multiple peer-reviewed publications.
