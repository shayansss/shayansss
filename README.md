### Hi there ðŸ‘‹  

Parts of my research data are allowed to be open-sourced:

- [HML: Hybrid Machine Learning](https://github.com/shayansss/hml): Implementation of a new hybrid machine learning technique for multi-fidelity surrogates of finite elements models with applications in multi-physics modeling of soft tissues.

- [PMSE: Pointwise Mean Squared Error](https://github.com/shayansss/pmse): Implementation of a new pointwise metric using Keras and Abaqus.
  
- [Fortran UMAT, FLOW, and SDVINI subroutines for a multiphysics and fibril-reinforced model of articular cartilage](https://github.com/shayansss/msc): This code is the Fortran 77 version of the UMAT, FLOW, and SDVINI subroutines of the cartilage model, I firstly proposed in my Master's thesis. The model with minor modification was used in several publications.
