# PhD and MSc Research Data

- [EHML: Extended Hybrid Machine Learning](https://github.com/shayansss/ehml): Implementation of several extensions, including physics-constrained data augmentation, on multi-fidelity surrogate modeling using TensorFlow and Abaqus.
- [PSA: Pre-Stress Algorithm](https://github.com/shayansss/psa): This is a unified optimizer for large-scale pre-stressing analysis in articular cartilage models using Abaqus Fortran subroutines and Python scripts.
- [HML: Hybrid Machine Learning](https://github.com/shayansss/hml): Implementation of a new hybrid machine learning technique for multi-fidelity surrogates of finite elements models with applications in multi-physics modeling of soft tissues.
- [PMSE: Pointwise Mean Squared Error](https://github.com/shayansss/pmse): Implementation of a simple pointwise metric for machine-learning-based surrogate modeling in Python using Keras and Abaqus.
- [BioUMAT: Abaqus Fortran subroutine for cartilage multiphasic modeling](https://github.com/shayansss/msc): This code is the Fortran 77 version of the UMAT, FLOW, and SDVINI subroutines of the cartilage model, I firstly proposed in my Master's thesis. The model with minor modifications was used in several publications.
